##Problem Statement 

A **problem statement** is a concise and clear description of an issue or challenge that needs to be addressed or solved. It identifies the gap between the current state (the problem) and the desired state (the solution). The purpose of a problem statement is to define the problem in a way that allows for focused research, analysis, and problem-solving efforts.

It **identifies the gap** between the current (problem) state and desired (goal) state of a process or product. Focusing on the facts: who, what, where, when, and why. The first condition of solving a problem is **understanding the problem,** which can be done by way of a problemstatement **(Kush 2025)**

**KUSH, M., 2015.** "The Statement Problem". Quality Progress. **48** (6), pp. 71.

A well-written problem statement typically includes the following components:

1. **Description of the current situation or problem:** Clearly and specifically define the issue or challenge that needs to be resolved.
2. **Explanation of the significance or impact:** Describe why the problem is important and the potential consequences or benefits of solving it.
3. **Scope and boundaries:** Clarify the specific context, limitations, or constraints of the problem.
4. **Measurable or observable aspects:** State the aspects or variables that can be measured or observed in order to assess progress or success in solving the problem.
5. **Desired outcome or solution:** Articulate the expected outcome or solution that would address the problem effectively.

By crafting a well-defined problem statement, researchers, project teams, or individuals can better focus their efforts, develop appropriate strategies, and make informed decisions to tackle the identified problem.

### Example

***"A retail company wants to increase its sales revenue and improve customer satisfaction."***

**Explanation:** A retail company is facing challenges in boosting its sales and keeping customers happy with their shopping experience. The current sales strategies might not be effective enough, and some customers might not be fully satisfied with the products or services offered. As a result, the company's revenue growth has been stagnant, and they may be losing potential repeat customers. The company aims to find data-driven solutions to increase sales revenue by identifying customer preferences, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing the overall shopping experience. By addressing these issues, the company hopes to see a positive impact on their bottom line and build stronger relationships with their customer base.
