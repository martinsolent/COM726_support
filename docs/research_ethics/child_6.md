# Ethics Policy


### Ethical Clearance

**ALL STUDENTS MUST OBTAIN ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THEIR PROJECT**

All projects must be carried out within the framework of the [University’s Ethics Policy](https://www.solent.ac.uk/research-innovation-enterprise/research-at-solent/support/ethics-and-integrity), see the portal for full details.  An ethics release form should be completed as soon as your project has been approved.  This can be done online via the Portal Apps.

**Data collection and online survey tools**
Staff and students wishing to complete data collection via online surveys must use the University's licence for Jisc Online Surveys. If they do not already have a user account, they need to email research.innovation@solent.ac.uk to request one or your tutor can yet an invite link sent to a cohort of students.

The University Research Ethics Committee acknowledges that surveys are an everyday part of education and research and enable the user to collect and analyse findings from a larger data set than handing out questionnaires/surveys individually. However, Solent requires that surveys should only be conducted using JISC Online Surveys. **It will be considered a breach of ethical regulations if any other survey tool is used.**

When undertaking research, it is important to consider implications for data protection. Please read the [University's information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://staff.solent.ac.uk/our-organisation/gdpr-at-solent)

### Informed Consent

From [Academic Handbook Section 2S (2022)](https://students.solent.ac.uk/official-documents/quality-management/academic-handbook/2s-solent-university-ethics-policy.pdf)

15. Ethical conduct in research and innovation demands respect for the rights of others directly or indirectly affected by the research. For human participants, both their physical and personal autonomy should be respected. However whilst it is recognised that much scientific research involving the use of human participants will, by its very nature, often conceal from participants the true purpose of the enquiry or experiment, this concealment should be at the minimum level essential to conduct that research. There should also be no reasonable expectation that harm would come to participants and that it should conform to the requirements of relevant professional bodies and any legal requirements. Additionally, participants should be fully informed and briefed upon completion with opportunities to be informed of the findings. Other than these circumstances, participation in the research and innovation should be on the basis of fully informed consent and participants’ rights to privacy should be guaranteed. Written consent should be obtained where appropriate. There should be no coercion of any kind and, where remuneration is offered, this should be carried out in an ethical manner. Care should be taken that it is not offered as an inducement to surrender ethical rights or accept risk of physical or psychological harm. Any remuneration should therefore only be at a rate 2S: Solent University Ethics Policy Quality Management Page: 4 appropriate to recompense the individual concerned for their time and expenses.

16. At the onset of the investigation, investigators should make plain to participants their right to withdraw from the research at any time, irrespective of whether or not payment or other inducement has been offered.

17. Persons carrying out the research and innovation should consider the ethical implications of that activity, including the physiological, psychological, social, political, religious, cultural and economic consequences of the work for the participants, possible observers and society prior to its commencement.

18. Where participants are not in a position to give informed consent the person carrying out the scholarly activity should have regard to the advice of the appropriate body. English law does not currently permit guardians/parents to give consent on behalf of mentally incapacitated adults. In such cases a declaration from a court is required which declares that the procedure adopted for the research and innovation is lawful.

All participants in your project should give their consent before any data is collected from them. Consent should normally be sought from any participant in advance of their participation 


 A key part of gaining consent is that ensuring the participant is fully informed about the reason for the study. This means that there should be arrangements in place for explaining the evaluation. This may be in the form of an introductory information. It should:


1. Explain why the evaluation is taking place 
1. Outlines its key aims and objectives 
1. Assure the respondent of confidentiality and anonymity 
1. Explain how the information will be used  
1. Explain how the respondents can receive information about the findings 
1. Explain how the respondent can find out more information on the study 
1. Thank the respondent. 

Secondly, it must be made clear to participants that they are under no obligation to take part in the survey. It must also be clear to participants that their decision to participate or not participate will not affect the standard of care or service they will receive. 

 If an individual is sent a questionnaire, and chooses not to fill it in, this is viewed as non-consent. This means that these individuals should not be followed up and asked why they have not completed or returned the questionnaire. To do so would be in breach of ethical principles. 

*If you are undertaking a User Experience (UX) it will already be the case that Informed Consent forms are already available. If this is not the case download one from the Portal*
