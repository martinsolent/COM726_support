# COM726 Support - Week 2

### Ethics - "Do No Harm"

All staff and students have a responsibility to ensure, as far as possible, the physical, social, and psychological well-being of those involved in any teaching, research, and innovation they carry out. In doing so, they should aim to anticipate and guard against potentially harmful consequences wherever possible. 

In addition, all research and innovation must comply with the UK legislation concerning, for example, Human Rights; General Data Protection Regulation and other Data Protection Laws; Freedom of Information; Obscenity, and Public Decency (this is not an exhaustive list). Where standing/specialist panels and the University Research Ethics and Integrity Committee wish to seek advice in this regard, they should, in the first instance, contact the Clerk to the Governors and the Universityâ€™s Legal Officer.
