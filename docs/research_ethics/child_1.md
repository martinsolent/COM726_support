## What is research?

***The systematic investigation into and study of materials, sources, etc, in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions and endeavouring to discover new or collate old facts etc by the scientific study of a subject or by a course of critical investigation.***

Research involves conducting academic investigations under the guidance of tutors or research supervisors. It provides students with an opportunity to engage in hands-on learning, develop critical thinking skills, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their field of interest. 

1. **Identifying a research area:** Students usually start by exploring various fields of study and identifying areas that align with their interests. This can involve attending research seminars, talking to professors, reading academic papers, or participating in research fairs.

2. **Supervisor:** Once an area of interest is identified, students typically will be allocated a supervisor. The supervisor provides guidance, helps define the research project, and supports the student throughout the research process.

3. **Designing the research project:** The student and supervisor work together to develop a research question or hypothesis and design a methodology to address it. This includes determining the scope of the project, selecting appropriate research methods, and outlining a timeline for completion.

4. **Conducting the research:** The student collects and analyzes data, performs experiments, or conducts literature reviews, depending on the nature of the research project. This stage may involve working in a laboratory, conducting fieldwork, or using computational tools for data analysis.

5. **Documenting the findings:** The student organises the research findings and prepares a report or thesis that presents the methodology, results, and conclusions. The report may also include a literature review and discussion of the implications of the findings.

6. **Presenting the research:** Researchers often have the opportunity to present their work at research conferences, symposiums, or departmental events. This allows them to share their findings with peers and tutors and receive feedback on their work.

7. **Publication and dissemination:** In some cases, research projects may lead to publications in academic journals or other scholarly outlets. Disseminating the research findings contributes to the broader body of knowledge in the field and enhances the student's academic profile.
