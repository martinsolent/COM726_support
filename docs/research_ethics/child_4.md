# COM726 Support - Week 2
**Hypothesis** â€“  is a belief held without proof that will be tested

In research, a hypothesis is a statement or a proposed explanation that suggests a relationship between variables or phenomena. It serves as a tentative explanation or prediction about the outcome of a study or the relationship between variables.

A hypothesis typically consists of two main components:

1. **Independent variable (IV):** This is the variable that the researcher manipulates or changes in order to observe its effect on another variable.
2. **Dependent variable (DV):** This is the variable that is expected to be influenced or affected by the independent variable. It is the outcome or the result that is measured or observed.

### Example

 ***"Increased physical exercise leads to a decrease in body weight."***

In this example, the **independent variable (IV)** is physical exercise, and the **dependent variable (DV)** is body weight. The hypothesis suggests that there is a relationship between increased physical exercise and a decrease in body weight. To test this hypothesis, a researcher would conduct a study, collect relevant data, and analyze the results to determine if the hypothesis is supported or not.
