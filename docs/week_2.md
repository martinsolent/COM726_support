### Ethical Clearance

**ALL STUDENTS MUST OBTAIN ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THEIR PROJECT**

All projects must be carried out within the framework of the [Universityâ€™s Ethics Policy](https://www.solent.ac.uk/research-innovation-enterprise/research-at-solent/support/ethics-and-integrity), see the portal for full details.  An ethics release form should be completed as soon as your project has been approved.  This can be done online via the Portal Apps.

**Data collection and online survey tools**
Staff and students wishing to complete data collection via online surveys must use the University's licence for Jisc Online Surveys. If they do not already have a user account, they need to email research.innovation@solent.ac.uk to request one.

The University Research Ethics Committee acknowledges that surveys are an everyday part of education and research and enable the user to collect and analyse findings from a larger data set than handing out questionnaires/surveys individually. However, Solent requires that surveys should only be conducted using JISC Online Surveys. It will be considered a breach of ethical regulations is any other survey tool is used.

When undertaking research, it is important to consider implications for data protection. Please read the [University's information on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://staff.solent.ac.uk/our-organisation/gdpr-at-solent)
