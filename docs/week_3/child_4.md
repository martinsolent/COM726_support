## The Review Protocol


#### Develop inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion and exclusion criteria help you identify what you need to search for when conducting your literature review. **We will look an example of what the given criteria may look like for our chat bot application.**

#### Inclusion Criteria

- Primary sources relating to chat bots used for education or learning purposes
- English language only
- Published in peer reviewed journals
- Study took place in the last 5 years
- Empirical studies that took places in a higher education setting
- The Study reported research methods and results

#### Exclusion Criteria

- Sources that are related to chat bots not used in an educational or learning setting
- Non-English language
- Non peer reviewed sources
- Study took place over 5 years ago
- Study did not take place in a higher education setting

It is important to refer to and review your inclusion and exclusion criteria while you are searching. 


#### Identify Databases

Once you know what type of literature you need to address your research idea and have developed your inclusion and exclusion criteria, you are ready to begin searching for literature. We recommend using online academic databases to conduct your search.

While the library has subscriptions to a range of [databases](https://libguides.solent.ac.uk/az.php?s=125080), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/search/advanced) is good.

#### Identify Keywords

You should identify the keywords that capture the essence of your research topic. The rationale behind this is that journal articles are indexed on databases using keywords.

**Keywords**
The keywords for are chat bot study could be as follows:
**ChatBot, ChatBots, Chat Bot, ChatBot, Higher Education, University, Learning, Adult Education, Adults**

#### Conduct Searches

We are now ready to conduct our searches. When conducting your search you should make use of Boolean operators - AND/OR/NOT. These commands use the principles of [Boolean logic](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963&p=1158594), a concept that as a computing student you should be familiar with.

Using the above principles this is what our chat bot study search string might look like:

**(Chatbot OR ChatBots OR Chat Bot OR Chat Bots) AND Learning AND (Higher Education OR Adult Education OR Adults)**

https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=%28Chatbot%20OR%20ChatBots%20OR%20Chat%20Bot%20OR%20Chat%20Bots%29%20AND%20Learning%20AND%20%28Higher%20Education%20OR%20Adult%20Education%20OR%20Adults%29&years=2023%2C2022%2C2021%2C2020%2C2019&articleTypes=REV&show=100&lastSelectedFacet=publicationTitles&subs=true


After conducting our search, we start applying our inclusion criteria.

We have filtered by date and just to include research articles. 

After applying our criteria, you can see that we have 98 remaining articles. We now need to get the literature into a format that lends itself to more in-depth analysis.

#### Exporting the search results to excel

ScienceDirect does not allow export to Excel.
