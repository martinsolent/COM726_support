## Literature surveys and research frameworks

The importance of literature surveys and research frameworks in a dissertation

Literature surveys and research frameworks play crucial roles in a dissertation. They provide a strong foundation for the research and demonstrate the researcher's knowledge of the existing body of work related to the research topic. Here are the key reasons why literature surveys and research frameworks are important in a dissertation:

1. **Contextualising the research:** Literature surveys help situate the research within the broader academic landscape. By reviewing and analysing existing literature, researchers can understand the current state of knowledge, identify research gaps, and justify the significance of their study. It provides a context for the research problem and helps establish its relevance and importance.

2. **Identifying research gaps:** A thorough literature survey allows researchers to identify areas that have not been adequately explored or unanswered research questions. This helps in defining the research objectives and formulating research questions or hypotheses. By addressing these gaps, researchers contribute to the existing knowledge and make a valuable contribution to their field.

3. **Building on existing knowledge:** Literature surveys enable researchers to build upon the work of previous researchers. By examining existing studies, theories, and methodologies, researchers can identify frameworks, models, or concepts that can be applied to their own research. This helps in conceptualising the research design, selecting appropriate methods, and analysing the findings in light of previous research.

4. **Avoiding duplication and plagiarism:** A comprehensive literature survey ensures that researchers do not duplicate existing studies unknowingly. By being aware of the existing literature, researchers can position their work as a unique contribution and avoid reproducing what has already been done. Additionally, literature surveys help researchers attribute ideas and findings to the original authors, preventing unintentional plagiarism.

5. **Guiding the research methodology:** Research frameworks provide a theoretical and conceptual structure for the study. They guide researchers in selecting appropriate research methodologies, data collection techniques, and analysis methods. By understanding the existing frameworks, researchers can adapt or modify them to suit their specific research objectives and context.

6. **Analysing and interpreting findings:** Literature surveys provide a basis for analysing and interpreting the research findings. Researchers can compare their results with previous studies, evaluate the consistency or divergence of their findings, and offer explanations or new insights based on the existing literature. This strengthens the credibility and validity of the research findings.

7. **Demonstrating scholarly rigour:** Including a literature survey and research framework in a dissertation demonstrates the researcher's commitment to scholarly rigour and academic integrity. It shows that the research has been conducted within the context of the existing knowledge and that appropriate theoretical frameworks have been considered. This enhances the credibility and quality of the research.

In summary, literature surveys and research frameworks are essential components of a dissertation. They establish the context, identify research gaps, guide the methodology, and support the analysis and interpretation of findings. A well-executed literature survey and research framework not only contribute to the academic discourse but also strengthen the overall quality and impact of the research.
