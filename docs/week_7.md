You have five choices when it comes to using photographic images: 

1. Create the image yourself
1. Commission somebody to create the image
1. Purchased the rights to use an image (royalty free)
1. The image is in the public domain or Creative Commons 
1. The image is being presented as “fair use” as detailed in copyright law

### Creative Commons

Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organisation that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardised terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realise the full potential of the internet.
