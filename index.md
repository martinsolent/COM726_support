# COM726 Support Sessions - Introduction

All Masters students undertake an extended body of work commonly called a Dissertation and an accompanying verbal presentation (Viva).

The content of the Dissertation should reflect your passions and interests within your field of study, and must be drawn from relevant theory, supported by the practical aspects of your degree.


**There will be 6 support sessions taking place every Tuesday 1300-1400 in HC005 Lecture Theatre - this will be on your timetables.**
